# rpki-aspa-verification-demo

A demo implementation in Rust of the version [17](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification-17) of the [draft for BGP AS_PATH Verification Based on Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) Objects](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification/). It implements the algorithms for both downstream and upstream paths with multiple unit tests for each algorithm.

This project was started at the [IETF 119 Hackathon](https://www.ietf.org/how/runningcode/hackathons/119-hackathon/) in Brisbane.
